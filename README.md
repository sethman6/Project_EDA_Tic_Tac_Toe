# Project_EDA_Tic_Tac_Toe

Two players (player X, and player O) play on 3x3 grid. Player X is a human player, and player O is a computer. 
A player can put his/her letter (either X or O) in an empty cell in the grid. 
If a player forms a row, a column or a diagonal with his/her letter, that player wins and the game ends. 
If the grid is full and thereâ€™s no row, column or diagonal of the same letter, the game ends at draw. 
A player should try to win in the lowest possible number of moves.
